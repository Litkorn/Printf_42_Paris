# ft_printf 42_Paris

I had to remake printf. It has basic conversions since I didn't made the bonus part ( old version had to make all the precisions flags, but in mine, it's only in the bonus part).
I did chose to not use the libft we previously made and to not use malloc, to make this project the simpliest as possible.

We had to replicate some of the behaviour, and I took care of 1/2 behavior just to make my project easier to use ( like %ld was supported in %d ).
All of this works, and I'm pretty proud of this since it is kinda clean hehehe.
